# First app created with React

This is a very simple app with 4 components. You can add a user (name & age - with very basic validation),
Once added it displays below as a list of users.

## Things to take away from this exercise

Found how components 'talk' to each other and how state is lifted from parent to child and vice versa.
There is also a console warning which I believe to be part of react bootstrap Modal transition.
